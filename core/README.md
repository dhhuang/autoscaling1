# FortiWeb Autoscale - Core

`fortiweb-autoscale/core` contains the core logic used to handle autoscaling groups of FortiWeb VM instances in various cloud platforms.

The design metaphor for `fortiweb-autoscale/core` is an API sandwich with cloud-specific layers on the outside and core functionality in the middle. Leveraging this API requires extending the following classes:

* `AutoscaleHandler` is a _base_ class which handles the core logic. This class should be extended to handle events invoked by each cloud platform.

The reference implementation is `multi-cloud-autoscale/aws`:

 * `AwsAutoscaleHandler` handles the lambda entry event and calls the base class methods to handle the core logic
 * `AwsPlatform` contains methods called by `AutoscaleHandler` to actually call into the aws api.
